# TooYummyToGo

This application allows users to create an account and login, as well as search which merchants exist, and order various products from that merchant to collect later. It is up to merchants to confirm that they have delivered each user's order at the time of approval.

This project implements the patterns of enterprise architecture described by Martin Fowler - Patterns Of Enterprise Application Architecture.
